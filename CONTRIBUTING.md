##### How to Contribute

### Basic guidelines

The master branch should only contain working and tested code. Everything else should be in a branch.

### AUTHORS file

When contributing for the first time, make sure to add yourself to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.

### Git Instructions

Clone the project, create a new branch using ``git checkout -b branchname``. Make all of the additions/changes that you want, then commit and push the branch to github. If you are confident that the code works and that you want to add the it to the project, send a pull request.

You do not have to create a new branch for every change, just make sure that you are not pushing to master directly. You can doublecheck that you are in the correct branch by running ``git branch``.
